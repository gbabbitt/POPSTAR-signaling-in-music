# POPSTAR-signaling-in-music

This repo is for code-base and PyQt5 applications for investigating signaling in musical contexts.

This project is in active development by undergraduate students at the Rochester Institute of Technology working with Dr. Gregory A Babbitt (Life Sciences) and Dr. Ernest P Fokoue (mathematics). Community collaboration is welcome...please reach out to us via email at RIT with an inquiry (gabsbi(at)rit.edu or epfeqa(at)rit.edu).

NOTE: This code does not actually do any significant analysis as of yet...stay tuned
