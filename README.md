# POPSTAR-signaling-in-music

This repo is for code-base and PyQt5 applications for investigating fitness signaling in human/animal vocal contexts.

As of 2025, this project is in active development by undergraduate students at the Rochester Institute of Technology working with Dr. Gregory A Babbitt (Life Sciences) and Dr. Ernest P Fokoue (mathematics). Community collaboration is welcome...please reach out to us via email at RIT with an inquiry for more details (gabsbi(at)rit.edu or epfeqa(at)rit.edu).

TESTING: Linux Mint 20

TO RUN: python3 popstar.py 

INPUT: myFile.wav or myFile.mp3

NOTE: This code does not actually do any significant analysis as of yet...stay tuned
